# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease risk using machine learning models. We use health metrics like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other features to train and test three models: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. The Random Forest model has been identified as the best performer.

## Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier (Best Performing Model)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

## Dataset
The dataset includes various health indicators such as:
- Age
- Cholesterol Levels
- Blood Pressure
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina

## Results
The Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy and precision, making it the most reliable predictor for heart disease in this study.
